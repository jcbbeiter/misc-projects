Google Games
============

These three scripts are just my solutions to a few of the Google Games challenges from the 2017 Google Games.

Script | Problem | Problem type
 ---- | ------- | ------------
| [orientation.py](https://github.com/jcbbeiter/misc-projects/blob/master/google_games/orientation.py)  | [Orientation](https://ggpuzzles.appspot.com/web/puzzle/orientation) | simple algorithms / solution design |
| [codenames.py](https://github.com/jcbbeiter/misc-projects/blob/master/google_games/codenames.py) |[Codenames: Hard Mode](https://ggpuzzles.appspot.com/web/puzzle/codenames-hard-mode) | graph traversal |
| [crack.py](https://github.com/jcbbeiter/misc-projects/blob/master/google_games/crack.py) | [Outsmart the Mastermind](https://ggpuzzles.appspot.com/web/puzzle/outsmart-the-mastermind) | web requests |

Note that the focus here was just getting the right answer quickly, not necessarily designing the best or most efficient solution.
All comments are added after the fact.
