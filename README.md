misc-projects
============

This is a repository for miscellaneous projects -- both to showcase previous work that wasn't initially on github, and to have a spot for ongoing projects that aren't big enough to merit their own repository.

[Google Games](https://github.com/jcbbeiter/misc-projects/tree/master/googleGames)
------------
I participated in the 2017 Google Games in Chicago. The problems have been released, so the scripts I wrote as solutions might as well be up here too. 

[Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/jcbbeiter/misc-projects/tree/master/sudoku-solver)
-------------
One lab assignment had us implement a sudoku solver in C++ -- this is my solution.
