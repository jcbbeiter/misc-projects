Deductions
------------------
(-0.25) Act 2 Question 1: did not answer how the Python and C versions of cat are different

		The Python version uses pop to process one argument at a time, while
		the C versions keep track of the index of the element to look at.

(-0) Act 1 Programming: You actually do not need two inner for loops for the sort_numbers function (second inner for loop is the crucial one) if the for loop iterates from i down to 0
