Google Games
============

These three scripts are just my solutions to a few of the Google Games challenges from the 2017 Google Games.

+ orientation.py: [Orientation](https://ggpuzzles.appspot.com/web/puzzle/orientation)
+ codenames.py & associations.txt: [Codenames: Hard Mode](https://ggpuzzles.appspot.com/web/puzzle/codenames-hard-mode)
+ crack.py: [Outsmart the Mastermind](https://ggpuzzles.appspot.com/web/puzzle/outsmart-the-mastermind)

Note that the focus here was just getting the right answer quickly, not necessarily designing the best or most efficient solution.
All comments are added after the fact.
