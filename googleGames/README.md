Google Games
============

These three scripts are just my solutions to a few of the Google Games challenges from the 2017 Google Games.

Files | Problem | Problem type
 ---- | ------- | ------------
+ orientation.py  | [Orientation](https://ggpuzzles.appspot.com/web/puzzle/orientation) | simple algorithms / solution design
+ codenames.py, associations.txt |[Codenames: Hard Mode](https://ggpuzzles.appspot.com/web/puzzle/codenames-hard-mode) | graph traversal
+ crack.py | [Outsmart the Mastermind](https://ggpuzzles.appspot.com/web/puzzle/outsmart-the-mastermind) | web requests

Note that the focus here was just getting the right answer quickly, not necessarily designing the best or most efficient solution.
All comments are added after the fact.
